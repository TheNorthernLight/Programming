1.



Write a program that asks user for two integers and prints the sum, difference, product and remainder of the two numbers.

Esibrand tulostus

Input first integer: 3

Input second integer: 5

3+5 = 8

3-5 = -2

3*5 = 15

Remainder: 3

Example output:
Input first integer:5
Input second integer:9
5+9 = 14
5-9 = -4
5*9 = 45
Remainder: 5

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)





2.




Write a program that calculates the hypotenuse of an orthogonal triangle based on the triangle legs inputted by the user. The leg lengths are assumed to be integers and the hypotenuse value is assigned into a double type variable.

Tip:

A square root can be calculated as follows (returns a double type value):

double root = sqrt (double_number);

You will need the cmath-library.

Example print

Input first triangle leg: 4

Input second triangle leg: 6

Hypotenuse length: 7.2111

Example output:
Input first triangle leg:8
Input second triangle leg:11
Hypotenuse length: 13.6015

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)
