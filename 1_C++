The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to writing programs with C++. Below is a C++ program. Your task is to rewrite it. In the next chapter you will learn how the program functions and what it actually does.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int number;

  cout << "Input an integer:";
  cin >> number;
  cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;
}

Example output:
Input an integer:12
You typed: 12

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)
