Write a program that calculates the number of hours worked within a specific period and prints the total number of hours, the average length of a day and an itemisation of the hours entered. First, the program must ask how many days of working hours shall be entered (max 30 days). After this, the program asks for the daily working hours. The program output shall have one decimal place of precision.

Hint:
It is easiest to implement the program using an array with 30 elements.

Example output:
The program calculates the total hours worked during
a specific period and the average length of a day.

How many days:3
Enter the working hours for day 1:5.5
Enter the working hours for day 2:6.6
Enter the working hours for day 3:7.7

Total hours worked: 19.8
Average length of day: 6.6
Hours entered: 5.5 6.6 7.7 

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

The following is the initialisation of a 5 x 5 integer array:

int matrix[5][5] =
{
4, 6, 25, 88, 5,
34, 5, 300, 4, 65,
78, 43, 11, 90, 125,
98, 585, 12, 63, 21,
45, 35, 9, 5, 1
};

Copy the initialisation into a program that prints the array on the screen and calculates the sum of the elements. Each line shall be followed by a newline character.

Hint:
The program can be implemented using nested for statements. You can use an if statement to check whether a newline is required. The numbers on the lines of the matrix must be separated by single spaces.

Example output:
In the array:
4 6 25 88 5 
34 5 300 4 65 
78 43 11 90 125 
98 585 12 63 21 
45 35 9 5 1 


the sum of the elements is 1757
