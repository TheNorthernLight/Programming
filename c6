1.

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer n (n>0) and prints the numbers 1,2,3...n on the screen one below the other. Write the program using the FOR statement.

Example output:
Enter an integer: 3
1
2
3

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)


2.

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer n (n>0) and prints the factorial of the number on the screen. For example, the factorial of n is designated n!, which means the number calculated as follows: 1*2*3...*n

Example output:
Enter an integer: 3
The factorial of 3 is 6

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "


3.


Write a program that asks for the students' exam scores (using integers 4 to 10) and calculates the average. The program must accept scores until entry is terminated by a negative integer. Finally, the program prints out the number of scores and the calculated average with two decimal places of precision.

Hint:
You can write your program using either the while or do...while statement.

Example output:
The program calculates the average of scores you enter.
End with a negative integer.
Enter score (4-10):7
Enter score (4-10):8
Enter score (4-10):9
Enter score (4-10):10
Enter score (4-10):4
Enter score (4-10):4
Enter score (4-10):5
Enter score (4-10):-1
You entered 7 scores.
Average score: 6.71

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)
