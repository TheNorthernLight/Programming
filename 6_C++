1.


Write a program that asks user for an integer n ((n>0) and prints the numbers 1,2,3..n on individual rows. Use for-loop in the program.

Input an integer: 7

1

2

3

4

5

6

7

 

Example output:
Input an integer:10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)



2.



Write a program that asks user for an integer n (n>0) and prints the factorial of that number on screen. Example: factorial of n is marked with n!, which means 1*2*3...n.

Example output:
Input an integer:6
The factorial of number 6 is 720

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)




3.




Write a program that asks for student's exam grades (integers 4-10 inclusive) and prints the average of the given numbers. Integers outside of the 4-10 range should not be included when calculating the average. Program receives numbers until input is finished by inputting a negative number. Finally the program prints the amount of grades and their average.

Tip:

You can use either while or do-while statement for this exercise. Use floating point numbers for storing grades and their average.

Example print

Program calculates the average of exam grades.

Finish inputting with a negative number.

Input grade (4-10) 5

Input grade (4-10) 7

Input grade (4-10) 8

Input grade (4-10) 10

Input grade (4-10) 7

Input grade (4-10) -1

You inputted 5 grades.

Grade average: 7.4

Example output:
Program calculates the test grade average.
Finish inputting with a negative number.
Input grade (4-10) 3
Input grade (4-10) 5
Input grade (4-10) 7
Input grade (4-10) 9
Input grade (4-10) 11
Input grade (4-10) -2
You inputted 3 grades.
Grade average: 7

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)
