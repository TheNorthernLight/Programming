1.



Write a program that prints the text "Hello world!" into the file "hello.usr". The file does not exist, so it must be created. Finally, the program must print a message on the screen indicating that writing to the file was successful. The text printed to the file must exactly match the assignment.

Example output:
Writing to the file was successful.
Closing the program.

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)


2.


The file "numbers.s" contains 4 integers. The numbers are on the first line of the file, separated by spaces. Write a program that reads the integers from the file and calculates their sum. Finally, the program prints the numbers and the sum on the screen.

Example output:
Numbers found in the file numbers.s:
93, 432, 65 and 22

Sum of the numbers: 612

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "




3.


The files "mata.txt" and "matb.txt" contain integer matrices of size 10 x 10. Write a program that calculates the sum of the matrices in a new matrix. The resulting sum matrix shall be saved to the file "sum.usr".

The matrix elements are separated by spaces and newlines. For example:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
... ... ...
... ... ...
91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
The sum matrix must be saved in the same format. At the end, the program prints a message indicating successful completion.

Example output:
The sum of the matrices has been calculated into the file sum.usr.

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "
