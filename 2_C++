1. 

Write a working C++ program that, when started, prints the text: “Hi everybody!” and a line break on screen. After printing the program shuts down.

Tip:
Everything you need can be found in the example program on chapter 2. When you understand how the program works you should be able to do this program as well. Program doesn't require slots i.e. variables.

Example print:

Hi everybody!
 

 

Example output:
Hi everybody!

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  
  cout << "Hi everybody!" << endl;
}



2. 




Write a program that asks user for two integers, calculates their sum and prints it on screen. After printing the program shuts down.

Tip:

Program is very similar to the example in the chapter. There are many ways to write this program but you will probably need two variables. You will also need the addition operator +.

Example print:

Type the first number: 3

Type the second number: 18

Sum of the numbers is: 21

Example output:
Type the first number:3
Type the second number:18
Sum of the numbers is 21

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int n1, n2, sum;

  cout << "Type the first number:";
  cin >> n1;
	
  cout << "Type the second number:";
  cin >> n2;
	
  sum = n1 + n2;
	
  cout << "Sum of the numbers is " << sum << endl;
}
