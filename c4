1. 

Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and prints the sum, difference and product of the numbers on the screen.

Hint:
This exercise is an excellent opportunity for practicing how to print several variables in one printf() statement. The variables in the program are integer variables.

Example output:
Enter the first number:83
Enter the second number:78

83+78=161
83-78=5
83*78=6474

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "



2. 


Write a program that prompts the user for an integer and checks whether it is even or odd. If the number is even, print the value 0, and if it is odd, print the value 1.

Hint:
A number is even if the remainder from division by two is zero.

Example output:
Enter an integer: 83
The number is 1

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "
