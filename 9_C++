The below program creates an object called “printer” in a class called “PrintClass” and then uses the object to print text.

Your task is to write the class “PrintClass” and the required method. (You don't need to copy the below code in the text box).

#include <iostream>

#include <string>

using namespace std;

 

// your code here

 

int main()

{

  char charstring[50];

  cout << "Input a character string for printing:";

  cin.get(charstring, 50);

  PrintClass printer;

  printer.print(charstring);

}

 

 

Example output:
Input character string for printing:second test
second test

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace and is not case-sensitive (the least strict comparison level)

Below is a simpler version of the previous program but the idea is still the same. Program creates an object names “thing”, which is an instance of the class “AskAndPrint”. Your task is to write the class “AskAndPrint” and create a method “DoYourThing()” that receives the string from the variable “text”, prints it's contents, reads user input and prints it on screen. Write only the missing class in the below text box. The functionality of the complete program can be seen in the example print.

Tip:

User may input spaces so reading simply cin >> text; is not enough.

#include <iostream>

#include <string>

using namespace std;
 

// your code here
 

int main (void)

{  

   char charstring[] = "Write the text for printing:";

   AskAndPrint thing;

   thing.DoYourThing(text);

}

Example output:
Write the text for printing:second example
second example

In the exercise both the main program and the class "Calculator" have been completed. Your task is to make up class "Printer" that asks the user for two integers, calls for the class "Calculator" method "Sum()" transferring the integers received as input to the method. Method "Sum()" calculates the sum of the integers and returns the result. At the end method "Print()" prints the given sum on screen. I.e. the code below doesn�t need to be copied to the answer field.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Calculator
{
  public:

  int Sum(int first, int second);
};

int Calculator::Sum(int first, int second)
{
  int sum =first + second;
  return sum;
}


// your code

int main()
{  
  Printer object;
  object.Print();
} 

Example output:
Give a first integer: 23
Give a second integer: 79
Sum: 102

Below you can find class "Dog" that is lacking a starting method needed for constructing objects and methods PrintInformation() and Bark(). Make additions to the class so that it becomes possible to construct objects from class. Also make up the missing methods. While being constructed the object will be given values: age, name, race and voice.


class Dog {
   int age;
   string name, race, voice;
   // constructor
   // method PrintInformation()
   // method Bark()
}


The following C++ program uses Dog class printing a print like the example print on screen. The code below doesn�t need to be copied.


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// your code

int main()
{
  Dog buffy(2, "Buffy", "Bulldog", "Hau!!!");
  buffy.PrintInformation();
  cout << "Dog says: " << buffy.Bark();
} 



Example output:
Name: Buffy
Age: 2
Race: Bulldog
Dog says: Hau!!!
